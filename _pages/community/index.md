There are several different ways in which you can get involved with our project.

The easiest way to start is to join the ODK forum at <https://forum.opendatakit.org>. Much of the community interaction occurs on this main forum so subscribe and participate.

Our issue tracker, wiki, and source code can be found at <https://github.com/opendatakit>. We are also on Slack chat at <http://slack.opendatakit.org>. The Slack archive is at <https://opendatakit.slackarchive.io>

ODK is an open source software project that is free for anyone to download, use, and adapt. If you would like to support ODK&#8217;s continued research and development, please consider making a tax-deductible [donation](//opendatakit.org/participate/donate/ "Donate").

Regardless of if you are a developer or user, we always need help. Email us at [team@opendatakit.org](mailto: team@opendatakit.org) and let&#8217;s start working together! Below are some ideas.

  * Great at design? Maybe you can help us with user interfaces.
  * Love making videos? Maybe you can do a screencast of our tools.
  * Natural leader? Maybe you can organize a hackathon.
  * Speak fluent Swahili? Maybe you can translate ODK Collect.
  * Experienced tester? Maybe you can triage bugs.
  * Gifted marketer? Spread the word about ODK.
  * Excel at writing? Maybe you can keep our wiki easy to read.
  * Want to donate? Give a tax-deductible gift [here](https://www.washington.edu/giving/make-a-gift?source_typ=3&source=CSEODK).
