ODK Collect 1.2.1 has been released. Upgrades are available on the <a href="/downloads/download-category/collect/>ODK Collect APK Download</a> page and from Google Play. Collect 1.2.1 is backward compatible with ODK Collect 1.2 and requires no special care when upgrading from 1.2.

**Notable features:**

1) Behr Atherton has contributed 3 new data widgets ([examples plus code snippets](/help/form-design/examples/ "Examples"))

  * Draw widget &#8212; freeform drawing
  * Annotate widget &#8212; take a picture then annotate it by drawing on top of the image.
  * Signature widget &#8212; capture a user&#8217;s signature

2) Autoplay of audio or video prompts as you swipe forward in a form. See the examples page, at the bottom, for how to enable that feature.
