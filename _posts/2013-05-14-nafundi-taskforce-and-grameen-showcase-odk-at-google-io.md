[Google I/O](https://developers.google.com/events/io/) is an annual developer conference that showcases the latest from Google&#8217;s product teams and partners. One of the exciting parts of I/O is the Developer Sandbox, where apps based on technologies and products are shown to attendees.

This year, three out of the nine presenters in the &#8220;[Develop for Good](https://developers.google.com/events/io/developer-sandbox#t-develop-for-good)&#8221; sandbox will be showcasing ODK-based projects! The three presenters are [Nafundi](http://nafundi.com), [Taskforce for Global Health](http://taskforce.org), and [Grameen Foundation](http://www.grameenfoundation.org/). Staff from all three organizations will be at I/O in San Francisco this week, so swing by their booths, and say hello!

Also present at I/O will be ODK core team members from the University of Washington. If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to chat with Waylon, Mitch, or Sam in person, now is your chance! Find them on the conference floor, share your ODK use case, and maybe get a demo of the upcoming tools.

If you won&#8217;t be at I/O, make sure to check out Nafundi&#8217;s [ODK customization services](http://nafundi.com), Taskforce&#8217;s [LINKS system](http://linkssystem.org), Grameen&#8217;s [TaroWorks system](http://taroworks.org/), and UW&#8217;s paper on [ODK&#8217;s future](/2013/02/a-sneak-peek-at-odks-future/).
