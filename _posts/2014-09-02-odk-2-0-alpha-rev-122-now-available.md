A [Getting Started Guide](/use/getting-started-rev122/) walks through using and modifying a form, and highlights many of the capabilities of the 2.0 tools, including bi-directional sync with the server.

The 2.0 tools are in <font color="blue">Alpha</font> or <font color="blue">Beta</font> status. We are referring to the combined set of tools as the &#8220;rev 122&#8221; software. To understand what we mean by the Alpha and Beta designations, see [here](/use/2_0_tools/#Release_Designations)

The rev 122 software works with the just-released ODK Aggregate v1.4.4.

Known limitations of this software are described [here](/use/2_0_tools/#Limitations).
