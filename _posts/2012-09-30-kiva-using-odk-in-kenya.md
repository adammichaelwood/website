A recent Kiva blog post entitled &#8220;[Technology in the Field: the Future of Microfinance](http://www.kiva.org/updates/fellows/2012/09/12/technology-in-the-field-the-future-of-microfinance)&#8221; discusses their use of Open Data Kit:

_When I applied to the Kiva Fellows program, I knew I’d be spending some time ‘in the field’, but I didn’t know I’d be out there transmitting Kiva profile information from a mobile tablet to Google’s Open Data Kit (ODK) platform!  After writing an automated survey interface and configuring the Android device, next I was on the farm with a loan officer collecting borrower responses, which were uploaded straight to the internet, Kiva photo included._

&#8230;

_Gotta love open source – an affordable way to do business in the field! And good thing some previous Kiva Fellows supported me during my learning phase, while I assimilated xml tricks, mobile device settings, GPS performance attributes and form management into my workplan. The loan officers I worked with during testing were actually the most thankful: they can’t wait to get beyond paper and agree that their increased efficiency and reporting capability will justify the upgrade._
